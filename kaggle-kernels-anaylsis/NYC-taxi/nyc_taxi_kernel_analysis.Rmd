## 1.1 Introduction
In this project we are going to explore the kernel above showing why the author choose the functions used, comparing to others alternatives and we are going to emphasize the interesting points of the kernel.

## 1.2 Load data
  
### Original code
```{r load_data_original, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("data.table")
library("tibble")

train <- as.tibble(fread('train.csv'))
```

### Comparison with others alternatives
In R, __read.csv__ is part of the regular functions and is used for load data.frame from a _csv_ file. But when we're dealing with a huge data.frame this function can take a long time to run.  
So in this part the author used a function called __fread__ that performs much faster than _read.csv_ (check the time of each function using profvis!!).  
After that other function came in mind mind: __load__.
This function is used to load variable that have been stored in a _.RData_ file and runs very fast comparing with _read.csv_ and _fread_.  
When is a good ideia to use _load_?
When it's possible to use a background process to update the data.frame and save it in _.RData_ file.  
Let's take a look at the three possibilities:
```{r load_data_comparison, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("profvis")
library("data.table")
library("tibble")

profvis({
  # fread
  train_fread <- fread("train.csv")
  # read.csv
  train_readcsv <- read.csv("train.csv")
  # fread + as.tibble
  train_tibble <- as.tibble(fread("train.csv"))
  # loading RData
  save(train_readcsv, file = "train_data.RData")
  rm(train_readcsv)
  load(file = "train_data.RData")
})
```
