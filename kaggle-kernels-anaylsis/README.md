# Kaggle's Kernels Analysis  
  
This project is from the [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/) __MBA in Artificial Intelligence__ course.  
  
The main purpose of this project is to learn R and Machine Learning taking a good Kernel by reference.  
So we reproduced, compared e studied the following EDA (check the result in the _Rmd_ file):  

* __NYC Taxi EDA - Update: The fast & the curious__  
"This is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis for the [New York City Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) competition with __tidy R__ and __ggplot2__.  
The goal of this playground challenge is to predict the duration of taxi rides in NYC based on features like trip coordinates or pickup date and time. The data comes in the shape of 1.5 million training observations (../input/train.csv) and 630k test observation (../input/test.csv). Each row contains one taxi trip.  
In this notebook, we will first study and visualise the original data, engineer new features, and examine potential outliers.
